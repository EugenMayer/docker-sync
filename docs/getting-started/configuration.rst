.. caution::

    When you change anything in your docker-sync.yml be sure to run docker-sync clean and docker-sync start right after it. Just running docker-sync start or stop will not recreate the container and your changes will have no effect!

docker-sync.yml
===============

The file docker-sync.yml should be placed in the top-level folder of your project, so docker-sync can find it. The configuration will be searched from the point you run docker-sync from, traversing up the path tree

In there, you usually configure one ( or more ) sync points. Be sure to decide which sync-strategy you want to chose, see :doc:`../advanced/sync-strategies`.

Below are all the available options, simple examples can be found in the docker-sync-boilerplate_.

.. important::

    Be sure to use a sync-name which is unique, since it will be a container name. Do not use your app name, but rather app-sync.

.. _docker-compose-yml:

docker-compose.yml
==================

You should split your docker-compose configuration for production and development (as usual). The production stack (docker-compose.yml) does not need any changes and would look like this (and is portable, no docker-sync adjustments).

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: "2"
    services:
      someapp:
        image: alpine
        container_name: 'fullexample_app'
        command: ['watch', '-n1', 'cat /var/www/somefile.txt']
      otherapp:
        image: alpine
        container_name: 'simpleexample_app'
        command: ['watch', '-n1', 'cat /app/code/somefile.txt']

docker-compose-dev.yml
======================

The docker-compose-dev.yml ( it needs to be called that way, look like this ) will override this and looks like this.

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: "2"
    services:
      someapp:
        volumes:
          - fullexample-sync:/var/www:nocopy # nocopy is important
      otherapp:
        # thats the important thing
        volumes:
          - simpleexample-sync:/app/code:nocopy #  nocopy is important

    volumes:
      fullexample-sync:
        external: true
      simpleexample-sync:
        external: true

.. tip::

    Do check that you use nocopy, see below for the explanation

So the docker-compose-dev.yml includes the volume mounts and definitions - your production docker-compose.yml will be overlaid by this when starting the stack with

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-sync-stack start

This effectively does this in docker-compose terms

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml up

Portable docker-compose.yml
---------------------------

Most of you do not want to inject docker-sync specific things into the production ``docker-compose.yml`` to keep it portable. There is a good way to achieve this very cleanly based on docker-compose overrides.

1. Create a ``docker-compose.yml`` (you might already have that one) - that is your production file. Do not change anything here, just keep it the way you would run your production environment.
2. Create a ``docker-compose-dev.yml`` - this is where you put your overrides into. You will add the external volume and the mount here, also adding other development ENV variables you might need anyway

Start your compose using:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml up

If you only have macOS- and Linux-based development environments, create ``docker-compose-Linux.yml`` and ``docker-compose-Darwin.yml`` to put your OS-specific overrides into. Then you may start up your dev environment as:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-$(uname -s).yml up

You can simplify this command by creating an appropriate `shell alias`_ or a Makefile_. There is also a `feature undergo`_ to let ``docker-sync-stack`` support this out of the box, by simply calling:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-sync-stack start

A good example for this is a part of the `boilerplate project`_.

.. _shell alias: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(command)
.. _Makefile: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile
.. _feature undergo: https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/issues/41
.. _boilerplate project: https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync-boilerplate


.. _why-nocopy-important:

Why :nocopy is important?
=========================

In case the folder we mount to has been declared as a VOLUME during image build, its content will be merged with the name volume we mount from the host - and thats not what we want. So with nocopy we ignore the contents which have been on the initial volume / image and do enforce the content from our host on the initial wiring


.. code-block:: yaml

    version: "2"
    services:
      someapp:
        volumes:
          - fullexample-sync:/var/www

to

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: "2"
    services:
      someapp:
        volumes:
          - fullexample-sync:/var/www:nocopy

.. _environment-variables:

Environment variables support
=============================

Docker-sync supports the use of environment variables from version 0.2.0.

The support is added via implementation of https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv.

You can set your environment variables by creating a .env file at the root of your project (or form where you will be running the docker-sync commands).

The environment variables work the same as they do with docker-compose.

This allows for simplifying your setup, as you are now able to change the project dependent values instead of modifying yaml files for each project.


.. tip::

    You can change the default file using ``DOCKER_SYNC_ENV_FILE``, e.g. if .env is already used for something else, you could use ``.docker-sync-env`` by setting export ``DOCKER_SYNC_ENV_FILE=.docker-sync-env``


.. code-block:: shell

    # contents of your .env file
    WEB_ROOT=/Users/me/Development/web
    API_ROOT=./dir

The environment variables will be picked up by docker-compose

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      api:
        build: ${API_ROOT}

and by docker-sync as well.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # WEB_ROOT is /Users/me/Development/web
    syncs:
      web-rsync:
        src: "${WEB_ROOT}"
